    <br>
    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>Hypertext markup language. It is the language that web browsers read to build a web page. <br>
        It acts as a ‘blueprint’ to display data on a user’s screen. This is the basic building block of
        the web. <br> Every page on the Internet is just HTML at its core.</p>
